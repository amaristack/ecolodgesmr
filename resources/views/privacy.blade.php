        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What is a Privacy Policy?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            A privacy policy is a document that states what personal data you collect from your users, why, and how you
            keep it private. It should be easily accessible and written in plain language to inform users how their data
            is being handled.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What is Personal Data?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Personal data is information that can identify an individual, either directly or in combination with other
            data. Examples include names, emails, addresses, IP addresses, photos, health information, and behavioral
            data tracked through cookies.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why is a Privacy Policy Important?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            A privacy policy is required by law if you collect data from users, whether directly or indirectly. It is
            essential to provide transparency on how data is collected, stored, and used to ensure compliance with
            regulations.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Where to Place Your Privacy Policy?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The privacy policy should be placed in an easily accessible location, such as the footer of your website,
            ensuring users can find it whenever needed.
        </p>

        <!-- Section 5 -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What Should the Privacy Policy Include?</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
            <li>What data you collect from visitors</li>
            <li>How you collect this data</li>
            <li>Why you are collecting it</li>
            <li>How the collected data will be used</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Section 6 -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why You Need a Privacy Policy?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Privacy has always been important in human society, and now, with digital services, privacy laws have been
            created globally. Companies that collect customer data must have a privacy policy in place to ensure the
            protection of personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers, email addresses, and social
            security numbers.
